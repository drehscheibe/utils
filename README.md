## led_brightness_pwm_table_gen
shell script that generates a brightness-to-duty-cyle table for LEDs
utilizing Weber-Fechner's law of perception

	Usage: led_brightness_pwm_table_gen [-c] [-i<indent>] [-n<num-coeff>] <steps> [<resolution>]
	    -c, --ctable       c mode: output table in c syntax
	    -i, --indent       indent to use for c mode (default: tab)
	    -n, --number       number of coefficients per line in c mode (default: 8)
	    -h, --help         show this help screen
	    -l, --low-active   GPIO is low active

	steps         number of table entries (e.g. 32)
	resolution    PWM resolution (default: 65535)

	See Weber-Fechner law for brightness perception.

	Examples:
	    $ led_brightness_pwm_table_gen -c 32
	    $ led_brightness_pwm_table_gen 8 10000


Examples:

	$ ./led_brightness_pwm_table_gen -c 32
	#define LED_MAX_BRIGHTNESS 31

	// generated by: led_brightness_pwm_table_gen -c 32
	static const uint16_t led_pwm_table[LED_MAX_BRIGHTNESS + 1] = {
	        0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12,
	        17, 25, 36, 51, 73, 105, 150, 214,
	        306, 438, 626, 895, 1281, 1831, 2619, 3746,
	        5357, 7660, 10955, 15667, 22406, 32043, 45825, 65535,

## terminal
shell script that implements a serial terminal based only on standard
tools like cat, stty, etc. and does everything that's needed for remote
access to Embedded Linux etc. and more.

	Usage:
	    terminal [device:/dev/ttyUSB0 [baudrate:115200]]
	    terminal {--help|-h}

- Public Domain -- do with it what you want, extend, sell, whatever
- can replace minicom, picocom, screen with under 250 lines of bash
- no ncurses or windows, just regular console with whatever backlog
  the terminal offers
- logging simply by tee-ing into a file
- supports break signal (Linux SysRq!) even over USB/serial
- has time synchronization short cut: you can set the local time on
  a remote Linux system where you are logged in (using date and hwclock)
- easy to extend
- can run scripts (but doesn't have "expect" functionality, so you
  need to work with delays)


## tree.sh
Simple tree implementation that also works with the busybox shell if
you replace '#!/bin/bash' with '#!/bin/sh'.
- Supports only graphcial UTF characters for tree lines.
- Implements only two of *tree*'s options:
  - --all/-a
  - --level/-L
- Adds one option that *tree* doesn't have:
  - --dump/-z <num-lines> -- output contents of each file. This is
    particularly useful for showing contents of sysfs files.
